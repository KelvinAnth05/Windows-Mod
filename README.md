Welcome to my repository.
This project is a small exploration I did into Windows customization. Itâ€™s just about enjoying the process of coding and making the Windows experience a little more personal.

About This Project
This is a light modification to the Windows Start Menu. Nothing complicated, just a few tweaks to make the interface more comfortable and suited to my style. If you enjoy customization and want to give it a try, feel free to explore and adjust it to your needs.
