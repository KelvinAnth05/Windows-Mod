**Welcome to _Windows-Mod_ repository.**

This project is a small exploration I did into Windows customization. It’s just about enjoying the process of coding and making the Windows experience a little more personal.

**About This Project :**

This is a light modification to the Windows interface. Nothing complicated, just a few tweaks to make the interface more comfortable and suited to my style. If you enjoy customization and want to give it a try, feel free to explore and adjust it to your needs.

**Feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request when you’re ready. No rush, just share your thoughts if you feel comfortable.**
